This is just an experimental learning project where I am implementing a
.NET CORE based backend for an IMDB movie application that has been coded in VueJs
Available at: ishwarc404/VueApplications 


Using a API .NET application, not MVC

Implementing a Controller -> Service -> Repository model with dependency injection
which will be useful while testing.
